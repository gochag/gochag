# Hello, my name is Tarlan.

### About me:
I've been working in app development for six years. I've developed applications for food delivery services, taxi services, video streaming platforms, and messaging apps. On my GitHub account, you can find several demo projects, as well as my personal application, MyFit, where I frequently make updates.
